# Smart Wallet : Simplifying User-Friendly Wallets with Enhanced Security

In the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain technology, the Account Abstraction Project emerges as a pioneering solution to tackle the challenges of key management and user accessibility within the Ethereum ecosystem. Born from the desire to empower users, including those unfamiliar with intricate technicalities, this project reimagines the way users interact with Ethereum by introducing an innovative approach to wallet management.

### Purpose

At its core, the Account Abstraction Project was conceived to eradicate the complexities associated with key management while enabling even the least tech-savvy individuals to seamlessly navigate the world of cryptocurrency wallets. The primary objective was to create a user-centric solution that ensures robust security, simplified usability, and universal accessibility. This project addresses the prevalent issues of poor key handling and the need for users to maintain ETH balances for gas payments, paving the way for a more inclusive and user-friendly blockchain experience.

### Project Goals

The Account Abstraction Project sets its sights on a grand mission: to onboard billions of users to Ethereum while guaranteeing their security and fostering a sense of trust in the system. This ambitious goal is underpinned by a steadfast commitment to democratizing access to the Ethereum network, making it approachable for a diverse range of users spanning generations and technical backgrounds.

### How the Project Addresses the Challenge

The crux of the Account Abstraction Project lies in the ingenious utilization of smart contracts to abstract away the complexities of key management. By introducing a logic contract that leverages proxy mechanisms and deterministic addresses using the create2 opcode, the project ensures consistent addresses across multiple blockchain networks. This means that users can seamlessly transition between different chains while retaining a familiar and unchanging address.

Through this innovation, the project revolutionizes the way users interact with Ethereum. Smart contract wallets become the conduit for users to interface with the blockchain, enabling a multitude of benefits that were previously unattainable:

- Enhanced Security: Users can define custom security rules, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to their accounts. Moreover, the ability to recover accounts in the event of lost keys adds an extra layer of security.

- Convenience and Accessibility: The project's design empowers users to share their account security across trusted devices or individuals, promoting secure collaboration and account management.

- Gas Efficiency: Users can seamlessly delegate gas payments, allowing them to cover transaction costs for others or have their fees sponsored by external parties.

- Transaction Batching: The streamlined interface enables users to bundle multiple transactions into a single action, simplifying complex processes and reducing transaction clutter.

- Innovation Potential: Developers now have an expanded canvas to create innovative dApps and wallet solutions that provide seamless user experiences, thanks to the improved support for smart contract wallets.

# Usage

### SmartWalletFactory.sol Contract Usage Guide

The SmartWalletFactory contract is designed to facilitate the creation and management of smart wallets on the EVM based blockchains. It leverages the Create2 functionality to deploy deterministic instances(Proxy) of smart wallets and provides methods to interact with these wallets.

#### Deploying the SmartWalletFactory Contract

- To deploy the SmartWalletFactory contract, we'll need to provide a unique bytes32 salt value as an argument to its constructor. This salt value plays a crucial role in the deployment process of the implementation contract, which serves as the logic for proxies across various chains. By utilizing this salt during deployment, you ensure that the resulting implementation address remains consistent across different blockchain networks. This uniformity in implementation addresses facilitates seamless cross-chain interaction and synchronization.

#### Creating a New Smart Wallet

- To create a new smart wallet, call the `createSmartWallet` function with the following parameters:

  - entryPoint: The address of the entry point contract. EntryPoint is a singleton smart contract that handles the verification and execution logic for transactions..
  - walletOwner: The address that will own the new smart wallet.
  - upgradeDelay: The upgrade delay (in seconds) for the implementation contract.

- This function will deploy a new smart wallet instance using the provided parameters and emit an event with the address of the new smart wallet proxy.The created smart wallet will inherit the logic from the common implementation contract.

#### Getting the Address of a Smart Wallet

- Use the `getWalletAddress` function to compute the address of a new smart wallet without actually deploying it. Provide the same parameters as when creating a new smart wallet. This can be useful for verification purposes before deployment.

### SmartWalletProxy.sol Contract Usage Guide

- The `SmartWalletProxy` contract serves as a proxy for the SmartWallet implementation, allowing for upgradability and efficient interaction with the smart wallet logic.
- Ownership and Upgrades:

  - The contract owner has the exclusive ability to upgrade the implementation logic of the smart wallet. Use the `upgradeTo` function, providing the address of the new logic implementation.

- Calling Smart Wallet Logic:

  - The proxy facilitates seamless interaction with the underlying smart wallet logic. Calls to the proxy's functions are delegated to the current implementation, enabling operations like transferring assets, executing transactions, and more.

### SmartWallet(Logic) Contract Usage Guide

The `SmartWallet` contract serves as the implementation logic for the smart wallet proxy. It contains a set of functions that allow users to interact with the contract, manage assets, execute transactions, and more. Additionally, the contract is designed to receive assets on multiple chains. Below is an overview of the key functionalities and how to use them:

### Transferring Tokens
